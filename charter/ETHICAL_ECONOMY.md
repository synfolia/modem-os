# MoDEM Ethical Economy Manifesto

Money is a tool, not a master.

Wealth must serve contribution, not control.  
Growth must uplift, not exploit.  
Power must be earned through trust and stewardship.

In MoDEM:
- Contribution earns recognition.
- Stewardship earns responsibility.
- Rising tides lift all who help build the future.

Money flows where trust grows.
