# Contribution Reputation (ContribRep) System

## Purpose
Track and recognize real contributions to MoDEM.

## How It Works
- Contributions earn ContribRep Points.
- Points govern grant eligibility and council elections.
- Points are public, non-transferable, and immutable.

## Examples
- +100 points: New Expert Model
- +50 points: Routing Optimization
- +40 points: Benchmark Contributions
- +20 points: Community Leadership

## Anti-Gaming Measures
- Peer Review Requirements
- Randomized Reviewer Assignments
- Quarterly Public Audits
