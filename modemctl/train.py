# CLI training trigger
# This script is part of the Maple-OS project and is used to train a DRL policy
# using a federated approach. It generates a memory scroll that simulates
# the training process and saves it to a specified path.
# The script is designed to be run directly and will create the necessary


# directories and files if they do not exist.
#
# The script imports necessary modules, defines a function to train the DRL policy,
# and saves the generated memory scroll to a file. The script also includes
# a main block to execute the training function when run directly.
